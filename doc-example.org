# See https://tutorialtodoapp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for nice home page!

#+begin_sidebar
*You will learn to:*

- write your docs in Org mode
- create tables
- create custom code blocks
- and much more!
#+end_sidebar

#+begin_abstract
This is an Org mode document, using the ~.org~ extension (supported by GitHub).

*Org mode* is an easy-to-write /plain text/ formatting syntax for authoring notes,
articles, LaTeX documents, books, Web pages, Beamer slide decks and much more!

This is a cheat sheet for *Org mode 8* (because of some markup syntax changes
since Org mode 7), using [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][ReadTheOrg CSS]].

Reading through all the [[http://orgmode.org/org.pdf][documentation]] is highly recommended, but for the truly
impatient, following are some quick steps to get started.

* Document settings

** Document description

#+begin_EXPORT org
#+DESCRIPTION: This document catalogs a set of tips and tricks for composing documents in Org mode.
#+KEYWORDS:  org-mode, syntax, quick reference, cheat sheet, recommended practices, latex, beamer, html
#+LANGUAGE:  en
#+end_EXPORT

** Section numbering

#+begin_src org 
#+OPTIONS:   H:4
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_src org 
#+OPTIONS:   num:nil
#+END_EXPORT

** Table of contents

Set the ~toc~ attribute to activate an auto-generated table of contents (limited
to its 2 first levels) at the top of document.

#+begin_src org
#+OPTIONS:   toc:2
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_src org
#+OPTIONS:   p:t
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_note
The ~ALT_TITLE~ property allows to set an alternate title (shorter, for example)
for a given headline in the table of contents and other running heads.
#+end_note

To locally insert the TOC at some random place, use the ~#+TOC: headlines [n]~
feature; for example:

#+begin_src org
,#+TOC: headlines 2
#+END_EXPORT

** List of figures

~#+TOC: figures~ is not implemented yet in the HMTL backend.

** List of tables

~#+TOC: tables~ is already implemented in the HTML backend.

** List of equations

* Section titles (headings)

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org :eval no
,* Biggest heading (level 1)

New chapter.
#+END_EXPORT

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,** Bigger heading (level 2)

New section.

,*** Big heading (level 3)

New sub-section.

,**** Heading (level 4)

New sub-sub-section.
#+END_EXPORT

** Numbered headings

You can create numbered headings up to a certain level by setting an option:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+OPTIONS: H:4
#+END_EXPORT

* Paragraphs

** Normal

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
A single newline has no effect.
This line is part of the same paragraph.

But an empty line

demarcates paragraphs.
#+END_EXPORT

** Line breaks

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
By entering two consecutive backslashes, \\
you can force to break lines
without starting a new paragraph.
#+END_EXPORT

** Horizontal rules

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
For an horizontal line, insert at least 5 dashes: this is some text above an
horizontal rule
-----
and some text below it.
#+END_EXPORT

** Text width

#
# In a figurative sense, the concept of visual balance is similar to that of
# physical balance| illustrated by a seesaw. Just as physical objects have
# weight, so do the elements of a layout.| If the elements on either side of a
# layout are of equal weight, they balance one another.| There are two main forms
# of visual balance: symmetrical and asymmetrical.

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

* Formatting text

Text effects.

** Bold and italic

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
/Emphasize/ (italics), *strongly* (bold), and */very strongly/* (bold italics).
#+END_EXPORT

Markup elements can be nested:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
This is /italic text which contains _underlined text_ within it/, whereas _this is
normal underlined text_.
#+END_EXPORT

Markup can span across multiple lines, by default *no more than 2*:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
*This
is not
bold.*
#+END_EXPORT

Org mode does not interpret a marker surrounded by alphanumeric characters as an
emphasis marker. So, you can't (easily) emphasize just part of a word:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
Not feas*ible*.
#+END_EXPORT

** Monospace, superscript and subscript

Other elements to use sparingly are:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- monospaced typewriter font for ~inline code~
- monospaced typewriter font for =verbatim text=
- +deleted text+ (vs. _inserted text_)
- text with super^{script}, such as 2^{10}
- text with sub_{script}, such as H_{2}O
#+END_EXPORT

** Smart punctuation

If the XXX option is specified, Org mode will produce typographically correct
output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, ~---~ to em-dashes, ~--~ to
en-dashes, and ~...~ to ellipses.

* Lists
  
 Org markup allows you to create *bulleted* or *numbered* lists. It allows any
combination of the two list types.

** Unordered lists

Itemized lists are marked with bullets. Create them with a minus or a plus sign.

They are convenient to organize data, and make the document prettier, and easier
to read.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- Item with some lengthy text wrapping hopefully across several lines. We add
  a few words to really show the line wrapping.
- Bullet.
  + Bullet.
    * Bullet.
#+END_EXPORT

** Checklists

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- [X] Checked.
- [-] Half-checked.
- [ ] Not checked.
- Normal list item.
#+END_EXPORT

** Ordered lists

Enumerated lists are marked with numbers or letters:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
1. Arabic (decimal) numbered list item. We add a few words to show the line
   wrapping.
   A. Upper case alpha (letter) numbered list item.
      a. Lower alpha.
      b. Lower alpha.
   B. Upper alpha.
2. Number.
#+END_EXPORT

You can have ordered lists with jumping numbers:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
2. [@2] We start with point number 2.
3. Automatically numbered item.
#+END_EXPORT

** Definition lists
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       f1a4a242-755b-4c38-9280-ee3f60e2b29a
   :END:

Labeled, multi-line lists.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- First term to define ::
     Definition of the first term. We add a few words to show the line wrapping,
     to see what happens when you have long lines.

- Second term ::
     Explication of the second term with *inline markup*.

     In many paragraphs.
#+END_EXPORT

** Separating lists

Adjacent lists sometimes like to fuse. To force the start of a new list, offset
the two lists by an empty line comment:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- apples
- oranges
- bananas

# Comment.

- carrots
- tomatoes
- celery
#+END_EXPORT

* Tables

Tables are one of the most refined areas of the Org mode syntax. They are very easy
to create and to read.

** Simple table

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
| Cell in column 1, row 1 | Cell in column 2, row 1 |
| Cell in column 1, row 2 | Cell in column 2, row 2 |
#+END_EXPORT

Org tables have cells of at most one line long: there is no such thing as
a multi-line table cell in Org.

** Column formatting

Columns are automatically aligned:

- Number-rich columns to the right, and
- String-rich columns to the left.

*** Table with aligned cells

If you want to override the automatic alignment, use ~<r>~, ~<c>~ or ~<l>~.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+CAPTION: Table with aligned columns
|          <r> | <c>          | <l>          |
|            1 | 2            | 3            |
|        Right | Center       | Left         |
| xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |
#+END_EXPORT

*** Table with column size adjusted

** Header row

You can create tables with an header row (by using an horizontal line of dashes
to separate it from the rest of the table).

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
#+CAPTION: Table with an header row
| Name of column 1 | Name of column 2 | Name of column 3 |
|------------------+------------------+------------------|
| Top left         | Top middle       |                  |
|                  |                  | Right            |
| Bottom left      | Bottom middle    |                  |
#+END_EXPORT

** A very long table

To test "sticky table headers"...

| Name of column 1 | Name of column 2 | Name of column 3 |
|------------------+------------------+------------------|
|         Top left | Top middle       |                  |
|                2 |                  |                  |
|                3 |                  |                  |
|                4 |                  |                  |
|                5 |                  |                  |
|                6 |                  |                  |
|                7 |                  |                  |
|                8 |                  |                  |
|                9 |                  |                  |
|               10 |                  |                  |
|               11 |                  |                  |
|               12 |                  |                  |
|               13 |                  |                  |
|               14 |                  |                  |
|               15 |                  | Right            |
|               16 |                  |                  |
|               17 |                  |                  |
|               18 |                  |                  |
|               19 |                  |                  |
|               20 |                  |                  |

|               22 |                  |                  |
|               23 |                  |                  |
|               24 |                  |                  |
|               25 |                  |                  |
|               26 |                  |                  |
|               27 |                  |                  |
|               28 |                  |                  |
|               29 |                  |                  |
|      Bottom left | Bottom middle    |                  |

** Table placement

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
| a | b |
| 1 | 2 |
#+END_EXPORT

XXX Different from the following:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
| a | b |
| 1 | 2 |
#+END_EXPORT

** Align tables on the page

*** Left

Here is a table on the left side:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+LATEX: \noindent
,#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
,#+LATEX: \hfill
#+END_EXPORT

The ~noindent~ just gets rid of the indentation of the first line of a paragraph
which in this case is the table. The ~hfill~ adds infinite stretch after the
table, so it pushes the table to the left.

*** Center

Here is a centered table:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
#+END_EXPORT

*** Right

And here's a table on the right side:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
#+LATEX: \hfill
#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
#+END_EXPORT

Here the ~hfill~ adds infinite stretch before the table, so it pushes the table
to the right.

** Table size

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
| Cell in column 1, row 1 | Cell in column 2, row 1 |
| Cell in column 1, row 2 | Cell in column 2, row 2 |
#+END_EXPORT

** CSV

You can fill a table from a CSV file using R commands.

* Links
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: links
  :END:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org :eval no
,* Links
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: links
  :END:
#+END_EXPORT

This document is available in [[file:README.org][plain text]], [[file:README.html][HTML]] and [[file:README.pdf][PDF]].

The links are delimited by double square brackets.

** External links

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
See http://www.pirilampo.org (automatic!) and the
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode Web site]].
#+END_EXPORT

*** Relative links

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
[[../README.html][Home]]
#+END_EXPORT

*** Email links

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
[[mailto:john.doe@example.com][email John Doe]]
#+END_EXPORT

*** Image links

To get image links, put a link to a file in the description.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
Clicking on the image [[http://orgmode.org/][file:images/org-mode-unicorn.png]]
leads to the Org mode home page.
#+END_EXPORT

** Internal links
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0d2b0cb2-116c-4a61-a076-4c641faf4346
   :END:

*** Inline anchors

Anchors are used to specify hypertext link targets.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
<<anchor>> Inline anchors make arbitrary content referenceable.
#+END_EXPORT

*** Internal cross references

Links generally point to an headline.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
See chapter [[#links][Links]].
#+END_EXPORT

To add a link to a figure (e.g., "See Figure 1"), just do:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+name: fig
,#+caption: caption
[[file:fig.png]]

See figure [[fig]].
#+END_EXPORT

You can also create a hypertext link to a document anchor in the current
document /or in another document/.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
See:
- Location [[anchor][cross reference]].
- Section [[id:0d2b0cb2-116c-4a61-a076-4c641faf4346][Internal links]]
#+END_EXPORT

** Extensions that define new hyperlinks targets

* Images

You can insert *image* files of different *formats* to a document:

|      | HTML                         | PDF |
|------+------------------------------+-----|
| gif  | yes                          |     |
| jpeg | yes                          |     |
| png  | yes                          |     |
| bmp  | (depends on browser support) |     |

** Inline picture

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
#+caption: Org mode logo
[[file:images/org-mode-unicorn.png]]
#+END_EXPORT

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
Click to see the [[file:images/org-mode-unicorn.png][Unicorn picture]].
#+END_EXPORT

** Image alignment (using positioning)

Books usually align/float images on the right/left of the contents.

*** Image is left aligned

*** Image is right aligned

*** Image is centered

#+name: test
#+BEGIN_EXPORT R :exports results :file-ext pdf :results graphics :width 8 :height 3
plot(runif(100))
#+END_EXPORT

#+attr_latex: :float t :placement [b]
#+results: test
[[file:test.pdf]]

** Image attributes and values

XXX Available HTML image tags include ...

| Attribute      | Value(s)                    |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
| ~:alt~         | Alternate text              |

* Admonitions

Admonitions (contextual backgrounds) are statements taken out of the content's
flow and labeled with a title.

Common admonitions are:

1. ~note~
2. ~warning~
3. ~tip~
4. ~caution~
5. ~important~

(Most themes style only ~note~ and ~warning~ specially.)

# See example at http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html
# or http://wsgiservice.readthedocs.org/en/latest/todo.html

Simple box ("inline task"):

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org

Description of inline task.
*************** END
#+END_EXPORT

*************** TODO Do this task
Description of inline task.
*************** END
or:

*************** END
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_admonitiontodo
Admonitiontodo
#+end_admonitiontodo

Alternatively to the inline tasks (for creating "TODO" annotations), if you want
such notes not to show up in the published version, drawers may also do the job,
e.g.:

  :FIXME:
  ...
  :END:

You can then control what drawers are exported with
~org-export-with-drawers~ (or per document with d OPTIONS item).

* Prose excerpts

** Quote

Use the ~quote~ block for content that *doesn't require the preservation of line
breaks*.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+begin_quote
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do.

The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose
main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with
thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what
each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible
because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human
understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce
each other.

-- Donald Knuth
,#+end_quote
#+END_EXPORT

A short one:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+begin_quote
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler. -- Albert Einstein
,#+end_quote
#+END_EXPORT

** Verse

In a ~verse~ environment, there is an *implicit line break at the end of each line*,
and *indentation* is preserved:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+begin_verse
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler. -- Albert Einstein
,#+end_verse
#+END_EXPORT

Typically used for quoting passages of an email message:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+begin_verse
>>  The meeting has been postponed to next Friday.
>
> Has the deadline for the report been moved too?

Yes.  And chekout http://www.doodle.com/ for rescheduling the meeting.

In the text body,
   indentation is
preserved.
,#+end_verse
#+END_EXPORT

** Block quote with optional attribution line

#+begin_epigraph
epigraph
#+end_epigraph

** Block quotes with their own class attribute

#+begin_highlights
highlights
#+end_highlights

#+begin_pull-quote
pull-quote
#+end_pull-quote

#+begin_blockquote
Blockquote
#+end_blockquote

** Non-breaking space

Insert the Unicode character ~00A0~ to add a non-breaking space.

FIXME Or add/use an Org entity?  Or use tilde?

* Comments

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
It's possible to add comments in the document.

# This Org comment here won't be displayed.
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_note
Org doesn't support *comments inside paragraphs* since a comment ends
a paragraph.  However, you can mimic inline comments with export snippets, e.g.,
~@@comment:...@@~.
#+end_note

#+begin_tip
If you have tables (for example) that you want to ignore during export, one possibility
is to use *comment blocks* or ~:noexport:~ subtrees.  Another possibility is to
*use* non-exported *drawers* (see #+OPTIONS: d:).
#+end_tip

If you want to ignore that part only during export, but still want to
use keep it active in the buffer, I suggest to use a drawer, with an
appropriate `org-export-with-drawers' value, e.g.,

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+OPTIONS: d:(not "NOEXPORT")
#+END_EXPORT

* Substitutions

** General replacements

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org :eval no
,#+MACRO: longtext this very very long text

Insert {{{longtext}}} wherever required.
#+END_EXPORT

#+MACRO: longtext this very very long text

Insert {{{longtext}}} wherever required.

** Styled references

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org :eval no
,#+MACRO: color @@html:<span style="color: $1">$2</span>@@

{{{color(blue, This text is colored in blue.)}}}

{{{color(red, This other text is in red.)}}}
#+END_EXPORT

#+MACRO: color @@html:<span style="color: $1">$2</span>@@

{{{color(blue, This text is colored in blue.)}}}

{{{color(red, This other text is in red.)}}}

Find more macros on [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-macros][GitHub]].

** Special characters

We also use substitutions to include some of the widely used Unicode characters
(like ©, converted from text characters to its typographically correct entity).

*** Accents

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- \Agrave \Aacute
#+END_EXPORT

*** Punctuation

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- Dash: \ndash \mdash
- Marks: \iexcl \iquest
- Quotations: \laquo \raquo
- Miscellaneous: \para \ordf
#+END_EXPORT

*** Commercial symbols

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- Property marks: \copy \reg
- Currency: \cent \EUR \yen \pound
#+END_EXPORT

*** Greek characters

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
The Greek letters \alpha, \beta, and \gamma are used to denote angles.
#+END_EXPORT

*** Math characters

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- Science: \pm \div
- Arrows: \to \rarr \larr \harr \rArr \lArr \hArr

- Signs and symbols: \bull \star
#+END_EXPORT

*** Misc

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
- Zero-width non-joiner: \zwnj
# Smilies: \smiley \sad
- Suits: \clubs \spades
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_note
You can insert a real "zero-width space" Unicode character by pressing
~C-x 8 RET zero width space RET~ or ~C-x 8 RET 200b RET~.
#+end_note

* Source code

** Inline code

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
Reference code like ~variables~ or ~functions~ inline.
#+END_EXPORT

You can also evaluate code inline as follows: 1 + 1 is src_R{1 + 1}.

** Code blocks (with syntax highlighting)

The source code blocks support syntax highlighting:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT cpp :eval no
/*
 * Application that displays a "Hello" message to the standard output.
 */
int main(int arc, char **argv)
{
  printf("Hello, %s!\n", (argc>1) ? argv[1] : "World");
  return 0;
}
#+END_EXPORT

#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp :eval no
(defvar hello "Hello")

(defun hello (name &optional greeting)
  (message "%s %s" (or greeting "Hello") name))

(setq tab-width 4)
#+END_EXPORT

# See http://sphinxcontrib-emacs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/domain.html

#+begin_note
You need =htmlize.el= in your ~load-path~, for the HTML export.
#+end_note

** Source mode

The following language strings are currently recognized:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp :results drawer :exports results
(concat (mapconcat (lambda (widget)
                     (widget-get widget :tag))
                   (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (it)
                                       (and (consp it)
                                            (eq (car it) 'const)))
                                     (cdr
                                      (widget-get
                                       (get
                                        'org-babel-load-languages 'custom-type)
                                       :key-type)))
                   ", ")
        ".")

** Line break

Code block with long lines:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp :eval no
testing testing testing testing testing testing testing testing testing testing
0        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456
#+END_EXPORT

For PDF (LaTeX), one  solution is to surround the code  block such as:

#+latex: \scriptsize
#+BEGIN_EXPORT R
print("This block is in scriptsize")
#+END_EXPORT
#+latex: \normalize

** Line numbers

Both in ~example~ and in ~src~ snippets, you can add a ~-n~ switch to the end of the
~begin~ line to get the lines numbered:

#+header: :eval no
#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp -n
(defun org-xor (a b)
  "Exclusive or."
#+END_EXPORT

If you use a ~+n~ switch, the numbering from the previous numbered snippet will
be continued in the current one:

#+header: :eval no
#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp +n
  (if a (not b) b))
#+END_EXPORT

** Callouts

In literal examples, Org will interpret strings like ~(ref:name)~ as labels, and
use them as targets for special hyperlinks like ~[[(name)]]~ (i.e., the reference
name enclosed in single parenthesis).  In HTML, hovering the mouse over such
a link will remote-highlight the corresponding code line, which is kind of
cool.

You can also add a ~-r~ switch which removes the labels from the source code.
With the ~-n~ switch, links to these references will be labeled by the line
numbers from the code listing, otherwise links will use the labels with no
parentheses.  Here is an example:

#+header: :eval no
#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion                  ; (ref:sc)
  (goto-char (point-min)))       ; (ref:jump)
#+END_EXPORT

# In line [[(sc)]], we remember the current position.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]] jumps to
~point-min~.

* Math

You can embed LaTeX math formatting in Org mode files.

** Inline math expressions

For *inline math* expressions, use the parentheses notation ~\(...\)~:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
The formula \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) has been discovered by Pythagoras.

Let \(a=\sin(x) + \cos(x)\). Then \(a^2 = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\) because \(\sin^2x +
\cos^2x = 1\).
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_warning
It's /not/ advised to use the ~$...$~ construct (both for Org and for MathJax).

Don't forget that ~$~ is also a valid currency symbol!
#+end_warning

** Math expressions in display mode

For mathematical expressions which you want to make *stand out, centered on their
own lines*, use ~\[...\]~:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
The /Euler theorem/:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = {{\sqrt{\pi}} \over {2}}
\]

LaTeX allows to inline such ~\[...\]~ constructs (/quadratic formula/):
\[ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} \]
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_warning
Double dollar signs (~$$~) should not be used.
#+end_warning

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
\[
\left( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{\sqrt x}\,\mathrm{d}x \
right)^{2} -
\prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4k^{2}}{4k^{2}-1} +
\frac{\lambda}{2n}\sum_{k=1} ^{n} \theta_{k} ^{2} x^{n} = 0
\]

The equation may be wrong, but it's a nice one!

** Equation numbers

Differently from ~$...$~ and ~\(...\)~, an equation environment produces a *numbered*
equation to which you can add a label and reference the equation by (label) name
in other parts of the text. This is not possibly with unnumbered math
environments (~$$~, ...).

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
The /Pythagoras theorem/:

,#+name: pythag
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

# See equation [[pythag]].

# The /sinus theorem/ can be written as the equation:
#
# \begin{equation}
# \label{eqn:sinalpha}
# \frac{\sin\alpha}{a}=\frac{\sin\beta}{b}
# \end{equation}
#
# See equation [[eqn:sinalpha]].
#+END_EXPORT

Only captioned equations are numbered.

Other alternatives: use
- ~\begin{equation*}~ or
- ~\begin{displaymath}~ (= the verbose form of the ~\[...\]~ construct).

~M-q~ does not fill those.

* Miscellaneous effects

** Include Org files

You can include another Org file and skip its title by using the ~:lines~ argument
to ~#+INCLUDE~:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+INCLUDE: chapter1.org :lines "2-"
#+END_EXPORT

#+begin_note
File inclusion, through INCLUDE keywords, is an *export-only feature*.
#+end_note

** Raw HTML

# http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html

You can include raw HTML in your Org documents and it will get kept as HTML
when it's exported.

#+HTML_BEGIN: <pre style="color:red">
Text can be preformatted (in a fixed-width font).
#+HTML_END: </pre>

It is especially useful for more advanced stuff like images or tables where you
need more control of the HTML options than Org mode actually gives you.

Similarly, you can incorporate JS or do anything else you can do in a Web page
(such as importing a CSS file).

*** Native DIV blocks

You can create named classes (to get style control from your CSS) with:

#+begin_example
,#+begin_myclass
This text is wrapped in a myclass DIV...
,#+end_myclass
#+end_example

You can also add interactive elements to the HTML such as interactive R plots.

Finally, you can include an HTML file verbatim (during export) with:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+INCLUDE: file.html html
#+END_EXPORT

Don't edit the exported HTML file!

** Raw LaTeX

You can also use raw LaTeX. XXX

#+LaTeX_BEGIN: \begin{verbatim}
Text can be preformatted (in a fixed-width font).
#+LaTeX_END: \end{verbatim}

* Footnotes 

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
It is possible to define named footnotes[fn:myfootnote], or ones with automatic
anchors[fn:2].
#+END_EXPORT

#+results:
It is possible to define named footnotes[fn:myfootnote], or ones with automatic
anchors[fn:2].

* Useful extensions

** Todo extension

*** Dates

Timestamps: [2014-01-16 Thu] and <2014-01-16 Thu>.

*** TODO We need to achieve...

*** DONE [#A] Buy GTD book                                              :online:
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "TODO"        ->  "DONE"       [2014-01-16 Thu 09:52]
    :END:

By default, ~DONE~ actions will be collapsed.

Note that I should probably implement that default behavior only for ~ARCHIVE~'d
items.

*** TODO [#A] Read GTD book
    SCHEDULED: <2014-09-11 Thu>

By default, *all* (active) entries will be expanded at page load, so that their
contents is visible.

That can be changed by adding such a line (into your Org document):

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org :eval no
,#+HTML_HEAD: <script> var HS_STARTUP_FOLDED = true; </script>
#+END_EXPORT

*** TODO [#B] Apply GTD methodoloy
    DEADLINE: <2014-12-01 Mon>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: hsCollapsed
    :END:

This section will be collapsed when loading the page because the entry has the
value ~hsCollapsed~ for the property ~:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:~.

Powerful, no?

*** Some note                                                   :computer:write:

You can add tags to any entry, and hightlight all entries having some specific
tag by clicking on the buttons made accessible to you in the "Dashboard".

*** Weekly review                                                     :computer:

Now, you can even make your weekly review in the HTML export... Press the ~r~ key
to start entering the "review mode" where all but one active entry are
collapsed, so that you can really focus on one item at a time!

** Bigblow extension

The string ~fixme~ (in *upper case*) gets replaced by a "Fix Me!" image:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
FIXME Delete this...
#+END_EXPORT

* Graphs with Graphviz

To enable the Graphviz extension, we have to add it to the extensions list in
the ~org-babel-load-languages~ variable.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp :exports code
(add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(dot . t))
(org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages)
#+END_EXPORT

It uses directly the ~dot~ command to process DOT language.

** Undirected

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org
,#+BEGIN_EXPORT dot :file images/graph.png :cmdline -Tpng
graph foo {
        "bar" -- "baz";
}
,#+END_EXPORT
#+END_EXPORT

** Directed

#+BEGIN_EXPORT org :exports results
,#+BEGIN_EXPORT dot :file images/digraph.png :cmdline -Tpng
digraph foo {
        "bar" -> "baz";
}
,#+END_EXPORT
#+END_EXPORT

* Graphs with R

The output from the *execution* of programs, scripts or commands can be inserted
in the document itself, allowing you to work in the /reproducible research/
mindset.

To enable the Graphviz extension, we have to add it to the extensions list in
the ~org-babel-load-languages~ variable.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT emacs-lisp :exports code
(add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(R . t)) ; Requires R and ess-mode.
(org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages)
#+END_EXPORT

It uses directly the ~R~ command to process R language.

** Example

Data to be charted:

#+name: data
| Month | Degrees |
|-------+---------|
|    01 |     3.8 |
|    02 |     4.1 |
|    03 |     6.3 |
|    04 |     9.0 |
|    05 |    11.9 |
|    06 |    15.1 |
|    07 |    17.1 |
|    08 |    17.4 |
|    09 |    15.7 |
|    10 |    11.8 |
|    11 |     7.7 |
|    12 |     4.8 |

Code:

#+name: R-plot
#+BEGIN_EXPORT R :var data=data :results graphics :file images/Rplot.png :exports both
plot(data, type="b", bty="l", col=c("#ABD249"), las=1, lwd=4)
grid(nx=NULL, ny=NULL, col=c("#E8E8E8"), lwd=1)
legend("bottom", legend=c("Degrees"), col=c("#ABD249"), pch=c(19))
#+END_EXPORT

The resulting chart:

#+results: R-plot
[[file:images/Rplot.png]]

** COMMENT ggplot2

#+BEGIN_EXPORT orgmode
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10)),
         aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point()
#+END_EXPORT
